# NextJS app directory dashboard using Role based model

This is a dashboard that has authentication and authorization enabled for components that we have.
This uses route interceptors and parallel route functionality to display modals by URL changes. Authorization is active per the different role. Depending on the user and their roles' accesses they are granted to use the functionality they have.

The project uses Shadcn UI and Tailwind. Quite basic to demonstrate what I can do in a week, so you don't feel to give me a test task anytime in the future.
